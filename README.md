# The only Telemetry SDK youâ€™ll ever need for TypeScript observability.

## Vision

Observability should give engineers a clear view of what their systems are doing and not feel like another setup you have to wrestle with.

Our goal is to give engineers the best observability tools the TypeScript ecosystem deserves, built on the OpenTelemetry standard and natively integrated with your favorite tech stack.
